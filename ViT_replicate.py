A machine learning paper is a scientific paper that details findings of a research group on a specific area.
The contents of a machine learning reasearch paper can vary from paper to paper but they generally follow the structure:

Section/Contents:
Abstract: An overview/summary of the paper's main findings/contributions.
Introduction: What's the paper's main problem and details of previous methods used to try and solve it.
 Method: How did the reseachers go about conductiong thier research? e.g. what model(s), data source(s), training setups, and
 were used...
 Results: What are the outcomes of the paper? If a new type of model or training setup was used, how did the results is
 of findings compare to previous works? (this is where experiment tracing comes in handy)
 Conclusions: WHat are teh limitations of the suggested methods? WHat are some next steps for the reserch community?
 Reference: What resources/other papers did the reseachers look at to build their own body of work?
 Appendix: Are there any extra resources/findings to look a t that weren't included in any of the above sections?

      f"\nA machine learning reserch paper is often a presentation of months of work and experiments done by some of the best work"
      f"\nmachine learning teams in thw world condensed into a few pages of text..."
      f"\nAnd if these experiments lead to better results in an area related to the probelm you're working on,"
      f"it'd be nice to them out... \nAlso, replicating the work of others is a fantastic way to practice your skills.. "
